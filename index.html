<p align="justify">Hi! I am Fu-Chi, and this is my Github Pages home page. Here you can find a description for projects I have worked on and a link to each repository.This site still needs a lot of work and more projects will be updated soon! (Last updated on January 15, 2017) </p>

<p align="justify">I am a master student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department at UC Berkeley. My interest lies in using quantitative approaches to unveil insights within the data and assist organizations in decision makings. <span style="font-weight:900">R, Python, and SQL</span> are languages I am familiar with. <span style="font-weight:900">Machine Learning, Optimization, and Visualization</span> are tools I find handy. Expected to graduate in May 2017,  I am actively looking for a job opportunity in data analytics. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fu-chi-shih">View</a> my LinkedIn.</p>

<a id="Grocery Retail Data Analysis (using R)" class="anchor" href="#Grocery Retail Data Analysis (using R)" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>- Grocery Retail Data Analysis (using R)</h4>

<p align="justify">Since September 2015, I have been working as a research assistant focusing on retail data analytics at UC Berkeley. This <a href="https://github.com/farahshih/Grocery-Retail-Data-Analysis">repository</a> demonstrates parts of analysis we conducted on the Dominick's scanner data. The database covers store-level scanner data collected at Dominick's Finer Foods over a period of more than seven years (1989-1997). Our goal is to build a model that can best describe the relationship between price, promotion, and sales of different products</p>

Kilts Center of Marketing at the Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, for making the <a href="https://research.chicagobooth.edu/kilts/marketing-databases/dominicks"> Dominickâ€™s Finer Foods data</a> available.</p>

<p align="justify">This is the final project for Data Analytics course at UC Berkeley. Our team focuses on the used car market in Germany. We act as a used car dealer in Germany and analyze the most recent data on ebay to do a basic analysis on used car price and factors that have significant influence on it. My mian controbution is python programming, which includes cleaning data, building model, and visualzations. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/farahshih/Used_Car_Price_Prediction">repository</a> for more details.

<a id="Optimization Case Study (using Python)" class="anchor" href="#Optimization Case Study (using Python)" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>- Optimization Case Study (using Python)</h4>

<p align="justify">This <a href="https://github.com/farahshih/Optimization_Case_Study">repository</a> illustrates a capaciated lot sizing problem of a door sub-assembly lines in a worldwide home appliance maker's refrigerator factory. The main goal is to determine lot sizes and production sequence for the factory's mixed-models assembly line. A mathematical formulation is discussed in the paper and a python script for Gurobi solver is uploaded. </p>

Summary of the paper:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li align="justify">Applied intervention analysis and fitted SARIMA model to monthly Taiwanese visitors travelling to the USA over a period of nineteen years.  </li>
  <li align="justify">Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R: plotted periodogram to examine frequency in the series, decomposed the series through loess method, and inspected the cross-correlation function of two correlated series.</li>
