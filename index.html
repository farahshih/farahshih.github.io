<p align="justify">Expected to graduate from UC Berkeley’s Master's program in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research in May 2017, I am actively looking for a job as a data analyst. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fu-chi-shih">Connect me on LinkedIn.</a> </p>

<p align="justify">My interests lies in using quantitative approaches to unveil insights within the data and assist organizations in decision makings. <span style="font-weight:900">R, Python, and SQL</span> are languages I am familiar with. <span style="font-weight:900">Machine Learning, Optimization, and Visualization</span> are tools I find handy. Have an analytical mindset and business acumen as a previous business consultant, while knowing how best to complement and lead a project team from different roles.</p>

<p align="justify">This webpage gives a brief description for my data analysis projects and each one has a link to the corresponding github repository. Please note that this webpage is still under construction and more projects will be added soon! (Last update: August 7, 2016)</p>

<a id="Time Series Analysis (using R)" class="anchor" href="#Time Series Analysis (using R)" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>- Time Series Analysis (using R)</h4>

<p align="justify">This is an individual project for the course <span style="font-weight:900">Introduction to Time Series Analysis</span> taught at Statistics Department, UC Berkeley. Please visit my github <a href="https://github.com/farahshih/TimeSeriesAnalysis_Coursework">repository</a> to see the codes and the final paper.</p>
<p>
Summary of the paper:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li align="justify">Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R: plotted periodogram to examine frequency in the series, decomposed the series through loess method, and inspected the cross-correlation function of two correlated series.</li>
  <li align="justify">Applied intervention analysis and fitted SARIMA model to monthly Taiwanese visitors travelling to the USA over a period of nineteen years.  </li>
</ul>


<h4>
<a id="Optimization Case Study (using Python)" class="anchor" href="#Optimization Case Study (using Python)" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>- Optimization Case Study (using Python)</h4>

<p align="justify">This <a href="https://github.com/farahshih/Optimization_Case_Study">repository</a> contains a capaciated lot sizing problem of a door sub-assembly lines in a refrigerator factory ran by company H. (Company H is a disguised name of a worldwide home appliance maker.) The main topic is to determine lot sizes and production sequence for H company’s mixed-models assembly line.</p>

<p align="justify">A mathematical formulation is discussed and a python script for Gurobi solver is also uploaded. (Many thanks for Professor Candace Yano's advise on the mathematical formualation.)</p>

<a id="Grocery Retail Data Analysis (using R)" class="anchor" href="#Grocery Retail Data Analysis (using R)" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>- Grocery Retail Data Analysis (using R)</h4>

<p align="justify">This <a href="https://github.com/farahshih/Grocery-Retail-Data-Analysis">repository</a>  demonstrates some data analysis work we conducted on the <a href="https://research.chicagobooth.edu/kilts/marketing-databases/dominicks"> Dominick's Database</a> provided by James M. Kilts Center, University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p>

<p align="justify">The Dominick's database covers store-level scanner data collected at Dominick's Finer Foods over a period of more than seven years. Our goal is to build a model that can describe the relationship between the price, promotion, and sales of a sub-category or a product.</p>
